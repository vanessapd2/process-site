					<p>I first interviewed Brenda Mancilla, she is the bilingual Outreach and Advocacy Specialist at
						Julie Valentines. Brenda describes the organization as welcoming and supportive and shared the
						goal of Julie Valentine is to provides preventative services, educational, therapeutic for
						female, males, children through individual or group therapy, school presentation, and
						assistance. The website helps to people get more information, access other resources for both
						kids and adults like coping skills. Also, provides a hotline, a live chat box, and an email
						space for web inquiries too, for the people who don’t want to. Brenda uses the website primarily
						to point and give more information, because when a victim is not in the right mind space to
						listen to all the information and will forget, the website is a good reference spot. Working at
						Julie Valentine is rewarding for Brenda because they can be the first to hear about a victim,
						whether it occurred six years ago or just recently, and get to walk them through the journey for
						healing and to thrive. Through my interview with Brenda, I learned that Julie Valentine got
						their name when a dead baby was found in a field of wildflowers around valentine’s day and the
						man that found the baby, wife’s name was Julie. I found this interview insightful on
						understanding what Julie Valentine stands for and their mission. </p>

					<p>For the User, I was able to Interview Nixmarie Alvarez, an immigrant services coordinator. I interviewed her because she could be a potential audience member for the site, as a volunteer or to gain more information on the topic of sexual assault and child abuse. As she looked for the services that the Julie Valentines provides, Nixmarie found it important to visit the website for her sexual trafficking victims or to get educational content for any of my youth to identify sexual predators. She noted that it could be important to have call to action buttons that can direct her into the case services needed. Also, equally important would be a translation feature so the Spanish speaking clients can understand the website and services and making “se habla español” more visible. She found too that the pages are oversaturated with information and the navigation bar with too many tabs. For Nixmarie and those in her alike field, a list of staff would be necessary to know who to refer themselves to when inquiry on services is needed. I will take these observations and recommendations into account when redesigning the site.

						Quote: “I believe Julie Valentines Center is an amazing nonprofit and extremely needed. We live in an era where sexual education is still a taboo in the 21 centuries. Julie valentines is not only for when you are in crisis but also provides advocacy, educational resources, therapy, and support groups for victims.”
