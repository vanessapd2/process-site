				<h1>Audience & Goals</h1>
				<p class="info">The next step of the design challenge is to narrow down the audience that will use site
					and create specific goals the site will achieve. </p>
			</header>
			<h2>Audience</h2>
			<div class="row 50% uniform">
				<div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/./audience1.jpg" alt="photo1"
							class="image-outline" /></span></div>
				<div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/./audience2.jpg" alt="photo1"
							class="image-outline" /></span></div>

				<p>I began by defining the audience involved and slowly narrowed it down into two major groups. It was
					seperated into the audience that <strong>Need Help</strong> and <strong>Supporters</strong> of Julie Valentine Center with a subgroup of <strong>Skeptics</strong> Julie Valentine Center. The Need Help group includes victims of sexual assault, child abuse, college and highschool aged girls, and those dealing with trauma. These are people who have been directly or personally impacted by sexual assault and child abuse. The other group of Supporters include resource groups like therapist, donors, churches, schools, government, etc. However, families, friends, people who don't have close relation, unbelievers of effectiveness, women who do not want to speak on the topic are under skeptics.   Recognizing the audience helped guide the goals and future decision on about the redesign of the Julie Valentine Center website.
