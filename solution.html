						<p>The primary CTA for Julies Valentine Center is “Get Support.” The goal of the organization is to
							provide free-confidential service to victims of sexual assault and child abuse. The primary
							audience are men, women, or even children seeking assistance, guidance, or looking for
							research. For this reason, it is at the center under the organizations name, it draws the
							most attention because of the contrast between the image and the red of the button. The
							secondary CTA is "Give Support." This is aimed to the second audience, which
							are people who want to help by donating, volunteering, or simply to become more aware. The third CTA is "En Español" I decided to add this after the interview with Nixmarie and Brenda. They both reminded me of the importance to have this option for the Latin community to have the same available resource and read through the information.

						<p> The Style Tile consists of advectives that I chose to accurately represent the updated website. This influenced the color sscheme and website layout, so the site feels consistent and cohesive. The advectives chosen are welcoming, reliable, supportive, growth, and trustworthy. These choices also ensure that the call to action buttons and images relate to one another. I also was sure to simplify the logo by just having the name without any other element. Its a simplistic layout that is trustworthy and welcoming for the audience intended.
