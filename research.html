						-Congress passed bill ending forced arbitration of sexual assault and sexual harassment Feb 10th
						-	Sexual assault refers to sexual contact or behavior that occurs without explicit consent of the victim, like rape, unwanted sexual touching, forcing sexual acts
						-	Every 9 minutes, that victim is a child. Meanwhile, only 25 out of every 1000 perpetrators will end up in prison.
						-	1/10 rape victims are male
						-	Women ages 18-24 who are college students are 3 times more likely than women in general to experience sexual violence. Females of the same age who are not enrolled in college are 4 times more likely
						-	Every 68 secs another American is sexually assaulted

					<p>email: To Whom It May Concern,

						I am an Anderson University student who is currently working on a web design project for a Graphic Design course. Your organization’s mission to provide service towards sexual assault and child abuse survivors speaks to me because I think it is an extremely important issue that needs care and acknowledgment. Thus, I have chosen to focus on your organization’s website for this project. 
						
						I wanted to ask if someone at your organization be interested / available to speak with me about the Julie Valentine center and its website? It would be extremely beneficial to have the opportunity to interview you.
						
						I hope to hear from you! Thank you so much for your time.
						
						Best, Vanessa Dominguez
