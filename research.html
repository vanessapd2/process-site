				<h1>Research</h1>
				<p class="info">To solve the design question, I conducted primary research about Julie Valentine Center
					and their current site. After, I gathered more information on sexual assualt and child abuse and
					other organizations who share a similar mission. </p>
			</header>
			<h2>Primary Research</h2>
			<h4>About Client</h4>
			<p>Julie Valentines Center is a private, non-profit organization that provides free, confidential services
				to victims of sexual assault and child abuse. The organization was founded by 13 female volunteers in
				1974, when there were no support services for rape victims in Greenville. Over the years, Julie
				Valentines grew from their small office basement of Fourth Presbyterian Church, into a house, and now
				into their large house building off White Horse Road, thanks to the Alliance for Community Trust (ACT).
				As they've grown their mission remains the same; stop sexual violence and child abuse and the impact of
				these crimes through prevention, investigation, collaboration, treatment, and advocacy.</p>
			<h4>Current Site</h4>
			<p>As I’ve looked through the <a href="#https://www.julievalentinecenter.org/">Julie Valentine Site</a>.
				I’ve noticed they have a consistent
				color scheme, different platforms for users to access them, many resources, testimonials, and even a
				newsletter. However, the main issue I found was not curating the website to their main user, that is
				women looking for needed resources and services. Also, there is a lot of information that is not easy to
				read through because of the large amount of text. with. The branding is on the right track but could
				need a refresh to make the site and their other platforms cohesive. The navigation bar has many elements
				that could be condensed into 4 tabs. Overall, content can be organized by what is most important for the
				user groups and simplified to be easier to read and interact </p>

			<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
			<h4>Data</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Congress passed bill ending forced arbitration of sexual assault and sexual harassment Feb 10th</li>
				<li>Sexual assault refers to sexual contact or behavior that occurs without explicit consent of the
					victim, like rape, unwanted sexual touching, forcing sexual acts</li>
				<li>Every 9 minutes, that victim is a child. Meanwhile, only 25 out of every 1000 perpetrators will end
					up
					in prison.</li>
				<li>1/10 rape victims are male</li>
				<li>Women ages 18-24 who are college students are 3 times more likely than women in general to
					experience
					sexual violence. Females of the same age who are not enrolled in college are 4 times more likely
				</li>
				<li>Every 68 secs another American is sexually assaulted</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Cultural Awareness</h4>
			<p>  On Valentine's day, Julie Valentine held their annual event to showcase Survivors and Hometown Heroes journey to healing from child abuse, sexual assualt, and sex trafficking. The past 12 years, more than 1,000 partners, professionals, donors, and friends gather to support Julie Valentine Center financially and celebrate their work and survivors. Events like these help to draw more awareness in the area and how people can help those in these situations.

			<h4>Solutions</h4>

					<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/./rainn.jpg"
									alt="" /></span></div>
					<p> <a href="#https://www.safeharborsc.org/">Safe Harbor</a> and <a href="#https://www.rainn.org/">Rainn</a> are large organizations that work towards providing assistance and awareness on sexual assault. I think their websites are successful because both Safe Harbor and Rainn makes it clear their goal and where to go for immediate help by including phone number and get help CTAs.</p>
					<h4>Testimonals</h4>
					<p> Testimonals include positive statements about financial burden relief, care with coping, therapy sessions, services, and advocate help.

					<blockquote>"Sometimes I think about that day and think I could not have made it through that day without my advocate." - JVC client after an ER accompaniment  </blockquote>
					<blockquote>"My experience at Julie Valentine Center has been life-changing. I was able to process stubborn areas in my life through the counseling and treatments offered. When I first came in for counseling I was shameful of the sexual abuse that had taken place in my life. I wasn't sure if I could speak about it to others...I now understand that it was a horrific act, but it is also common...I now have a sense of peace & a glow that is radiant beyond measures. I'm ready to talk to others about my experiences, both the sexual abuse and the role that Julie Valentine Center played in healing me." - JVC Therapy Client  </blockquote>
					<blockquote>"I was sexually assaulted...a lady from rape crisis met me at the hospital, and suggested therapy. I was extremely upset, so I made an appointment. I met with my therapist. We have only met three times, and every meeting has been very beneficial. I now feel capable to move on with my life when before I felt hopeless." - JVC Therapy Client</blockquote>
