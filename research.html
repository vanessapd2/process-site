			<h2>Primary Research</h2>
			<h4>About Client</h4>
			<p>Julie Valentines Center is a private, non-profit organization that provides free, confidential services to victims of sexual assault and child abuse. The organization was founded by 13 female volunteers in 1974, when there were no support services for rape victims in Greenville. Over the years, Julie Valentines grew from their small office basement of Fourth Presbyterian Church, into a house, and now into their large house building off White Horse Road, thanks to the Alliance for Community Trust (ACT). As they've grown their mission remains the same; stop sexual violence and child abuse and the impact of these crimes through prevention, investigation, collaboration, treatment, and advocacy.</p>
			<h4>Current Site</h4>
			<p>As I’ve looked through the Julie Valentine site, (link it here), I’ve noticed they have a consistent color scheme, different platforms for users to access them, many resources, testimonials, and even a newsletter. However, the main issue I found was not curating the website to their main user, that is women looking for needed resources and services. Also, there is a lot of information that is not easy to read through because of the large amount of text. with. The branding is on the right track but could need a refresh to make the site and their other platforms cohesive. The navigation bar has many elements that could be condensed into 4 tabs. Overall, content can be organized by what is most important for the user groups and simplified to be easier to read and interact </p>
			<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
			<h4>Data</h4>
			<p> Congress passed bill ending forced arbitration of sexual assault and sexual harassment Feb 10th </p>
			<p>Sexual assault refers to sexual contact or behavior that occurs without explicit consent of the
				victim, like rape, unwanted sexual touching, forcing sexual acts</p>	
			<p> Every 9 minutes, that victim is a child. Meanwhile, only 25 out of every 1000 perpetrators will end up
				in prison.</p>
			<p>1/10 rape victims are male</p>
			<p> Women ages 18-24 who are college students are 3 times more likely than women in general to experience
				sexual violence. Females of the same age who are not enrolled in college are 4 times more likely</p>
			<p>Every 68 secs another American is sexually assaulted</p>
